With this approach we still have to modify the the swim() and the fly() method for the class that implements 
a kind of swimming  or flying like regular flying/swimming.

For example - If the there is a change in the functionality of 'Regular Swimming' we have to go through all 
the sub classes of Duck and change the logic of 'Regular Swimming'. This is a pain and does not support code reuse.
