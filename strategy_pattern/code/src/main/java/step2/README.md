A new beginner way !! - Is to override the fly method of MallardDuck at implement with 'Do Nothing' inside the method.

This approach has a design issues--

With constant change in spec a, there is a chance of having new Duck types every month  and hence we will end up 
overriding the  different methods for each DuckType classes with Do Nothing .
